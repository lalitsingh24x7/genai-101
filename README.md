# From Zero to GenAI üöÄ

Welcome to **From Zero to GenAI**, a curated learning journey for developers, data engineers, and enthusiasts looking to dive into the world of Generative AI from the ground up.

This repository is designed to take you step-by-step from **no prior experience** to building **real-world GenAI applications** using modern tools and frameworks like OpenAI APIs, LangChain, Hugging Face, and more.

## ‚ú® What You‚Äôll Find Here

- üìò **Conceptual Guides** ‚Äì Understand the fundamentals of GenAI, LLMs, tokenization, embeddings, and prompt engineering.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-on Projects** ‚Äì Build your own GenAI apps like text generators, chatbots, image generators, and more.
- üîó **API Integrations** ‚Äì Work with OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and other popular platforms.
- üéØ **Use Case Walkthroughs** ‚Äì Implement GenAI in real scenarios (e.g., content creation, summarization, code generation).
- üß∞ **Toolkits & Frameworks** ‚Äì Intro to LangChain, Vector DBs, Pinecone, and other essential tools.
- ‚úÖ **Beginner-Friendly** ‚Äì No prior ML or deep learning background required.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who This Is For

- Aspiring ML Engineers
- Backend/Full-stack Devs transitioning to AI
- Data Engineers looking to upskill
- Curious builders and tinkerers
